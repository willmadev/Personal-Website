## Design

I designed this website using Adobe XD. I started by choosing colors and fonts to make a theme and color palette and then built the pages out. One thing I realized after the design process was that the font sizes I chose were too big since the design window was smaller than the actual size of the browser window. 

## Gatsby

This was my first time using React, so there was a lot I needed to learn from components to JSX. I chose Gatsby because many people recommended it and other static site generators for simple websites that could be compiled at build time.
